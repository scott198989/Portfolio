Hey there, welcome to my portfolio! If you're here, chances are you're interested in what I can do. And let me tell you, there's quite a bit. From HTML and JavaScript to throwing in some smooth CSS styles, this portfolio aims to showcase my journey into the tech world.

I gotta give a shoutout to Codehal. The layout, responsive design, and functionality of their work got my creative juices flowing and served as inspiration for this portfolio.  To see the site in action, please visit: https://www.scott-tuschl.com
