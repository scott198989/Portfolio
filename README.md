## Content

Hello!  Thank you for checking out my README!  This is my portfolio written in HTML, JavaScript, and styled with CSS.  I would like to give credit to Codehal for the inspiration of this portfolio.  I am really fascinated with the layout, the responsive design, and the functionality. My favorite sections include the contact me, using the power of formspree, and the schedule a meeting using Setmore.  I hope you enjoy viewing my profile, and please, if you have questions, comments or simply want to get in touch, do not hesitate to contact me!
